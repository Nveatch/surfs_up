# surfs_up

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to take temperature data from Oahu for the months of June and December, and perform statistical analysis to assess the feasibility of a year-round surf and ice cream shop business.  

## Results
![June and December Stat](https://github.com/Nveatch/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/oahu_stats.png)

*The average temperatures for June and December are roughly the same, ~75 to 71

*Max temperatures for both months are also almost the same, 85 for June and 83 for December

*Median temperatures for both months is in the 70s, with December being slightly lower at 71 (vs. 75 for June) 

## Summary
From this analysis, it would appear that it is feasible to run the surf and ice cream shop year round. Colder temperatures would be the deciding factor, and yet from this data, is appears December isn't much colder than June in Oahu. The average temperatures are similar, as are the maxes, and while December has a lower minimum, its only about 10% lower than June's minimum, a factor which I would offset by the fact that the medians are similar, so it can't be frequently that cold. Two additional queries I would run are:

1. A precipitation query for June and December, as rain frequency is just as important to feasibility as temperature
 
2. The same query for temperature, but narrowing it down to just the most recent few years, to see if the temperature results have perhaps gotten colder in recent years, but is being offset by the older data
